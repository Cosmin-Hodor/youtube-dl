## Download with youtube-dl

This code uses the youtube_dl crate to download a video from YouTube and save it to the specified file path. The code takes two command-line arguments: the URL of the video to download and the name of the file to save the video as.

The code first collects the command-line arguments into a vector of strings args. It then retrieves the URL and filename from the args vector and stores them in the url and filename variables, respectively. If the first or second argument is not provided, an empty string is assigned as a default.

The code then calls the download function from the downloader module in the youtube_dl crate, passing in the url as an argument. This function returns a Result object that either contains the video file as a Vec<u8> or an error message.

In the match statement, the code checks the value of the Result object. If it is Ok, the video file is written to the specified file path using the write_all method. If it is Err, the error message is printed to the console using println!.
